WHAT IS SORTING??
Arranging data in a particular format , either ascending or descending order.

TYPES OF SORTING??
Sorting -->Space Used-->In place : Sorting Algorithm which does not require any extra space for sorting e.g Bubble Sort
       |            |-->Out of Place : Sorting Algorithm which does  require any extra space for sorting e.g Merge Sort
       |
       |-->Stability -->Stable : After sorting the contents does not change the sequence of similar content in which they appear e.g Insertion sort
                    |-->Unstable : After sorting the contents does  change the sequence of similar content in which they appear e.g Quick sort

SORTING TERMINOLOGY??
Increasing ,decreasing , non increasing ,non decreasing order.

Bubble sort Algorithm:Also referred as sinking sort.
-Repeatedly compare each pair of adjacent items and swap them if they are in wrong order.
 TC: O(N*N) , SC: O(1)
 
 When to use Bubble sort??
 - when the  input is almost sorted
 - Space is a concern
 - Easy to implement 
 
 When to avoid bubble sort ??
 - Average time complexity is poor.
 
 Selection Sort Algorithm : we repeatedly find min element and move it to the sorted  part of array to make unsorted part sorted.
 When to use selection sort ?
 - When we have  insufficient memory
 - Easy to implement
 
 When to avoid Selection sort?
 - When time is a concern
 
 TC: O(N*N) SC:O(1)
 
 Insertion Sort Algorithm: 
 
 Divide the  given array into two part .
 Take first element from unsorted array  and find its correct position in sorted array.
 Repeat until unsorted array is empty.
 
 When to use Insertion sort?
 - When we have insufficient memory
 - Easy to implement
 - When we have continuous in flow of numbers and we want to keep them sorted.
 
 When to avoid insertion sort?
 -when time is a concern.
 
 TC : O(N*N) SC:O(1)
 
 Bucket Sort Algorithm:
 
 Create buckets and distribute  elements of array  into buckets 
 Sort bucket individually
 Merge bucket after sorting
 
 Number of buckets =round(sqrt(number of elements))
 appropriate bucket=ceil(Value*number of buckets /maxValue)
 
 When to use bucket sort??
 -When input uniformly distributed over range
 When to avoid bucket sort??
 -When space is a concern
